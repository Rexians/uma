# Contributing to UMA
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've done any changes, update the README.
3. Ensure the changes passes in the tests.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact me if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Rexians/uma/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Rexians/uma/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Bug reports should have that much information that would make the work of developer easy.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. This includes sample code that *anyone* with a base Python setup can run to reproduce what you were seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
